## Senior-Project-Backend

#### Current Functionality:
- JWT authorization (/register, /authenticate)
- /problem, /track endpoints partially implemented

#### TODO Functionality:
- extend the Problem class. Fix fields (Categories: String -> List<String), (TestCases: String -> List<Pair<String,String>>). The problem is the database can not store collections in its table. So, currently, we just store Strings.
- extend the Track class
- extend the endpoints base
- etc.

#### Postman directory to test apps. Fork it
